# Nutrition

Nutrition is a highly configurable mod to enable the creation of health systems in Minecraft.

See [releases tab for downloads](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/releases), and [Wiki for documentation](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/wiki).

![Nutrition GUI](screenshots/gui.png "Nutrition GUI")

Through its [config files](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/wiki/Configuration), Nutrition allows you to define custom food groups (called [nutrients](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/wiki/Nutrients)) which apply [effects](https://github.com/WesCook/Nutrition/wiki/Effects) based on nutrition levels.

By default, Nutrition comes configured with the classic five food group system: dairy, fruit, grain, protein, and vegetables.  However many different systems are possible.  Some examples include:

* A spicy tolerance bar, where eating enough spicy foods will grant a permanent resistance to fire.
* A zombie simulation where you must constantly eat brains/flesh to avoid negative effects.
* Gluten intolerance.  Eat bread, get sick.
